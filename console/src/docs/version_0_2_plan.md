# Version 0.2 Planning Guide
## Purpose
The purpose of this file is to state the vision and goals for version 0.2 of _On Purpose_. 

## Background
This plan was put together after getting feedback on version 0.1 of _On Purpose_ at the 2024 Hack-a-thon, along with ideas that I have had and group conversations that we had.

## Summary & Vision of Plan

### Support for Reactive Work (i.e. Interruptions)
An interruption is something that you do in support of work that you are not currently driving. However reactive work is a better term because this term does not imply judgement and  something that someone else is driving or it is something that you are doing .
Expected interruptions & support & reactive
Unexpected interruptions
Log interruption time to unexpected or to an expected interruption

Have a regular interruption planning where you state how much time to pay towards interruptions

Waiting on something is the act of waiting for someone to do something knowing that once that happens then you will have a defined or understood thing to do. Reactive is for things that you are driving where the next step is to wait and see what happens and then respond to the situation. For example after I finish a project by deploying it to production then I can mark that project as completed except that I need to be reactive to any issues that come up. This would create a potential interruption of Aside from Rather than waiting or ready now you can state that the item's next step is to be reactive. Then you can state that you need to 

The user should state how often they want to review their budget for interruptions and for dealing with interruptions.

### Reflect & Summarize
The goal is to add functionality that makes it possible to reflect 

## Implementation Details
### Support for Reactive Work (i.e. Interruptions)
#### Single Item View
When in a single item view in a bullet list there is a menu item for logging an interruption. When you click on this it brings up a list of all expected interruptions, sorted by how recently something was logged against that item, which makes it possible for no longer relevant items to naturally fall off the list. The list also has a menu item for this being an unexpected interruption.

After logging an interruption if there is already time allocated to that interruption then a message is printed that time has already been allocated. However if time has not been allocated to that interruption then the user will be asked where the time should come from. 

#### Reviewing Interruption Budget
By default an interruption budget is reviewed daily but when reviewing the interruption budget there is a menu option for changing the review frequency.
