# Routines & Life Areas

The purpose of this page is to brainstorm ideas for how to properly represent a Life Area and Routine. Life Area is at the top so a Routine has a Life Area as a parent.

## Example

Life Area
*Work
*Family
*Personal
*Fitness
*Hobby

Ｗｏｒｋ 8hrs each weekday, not Sunday, normalize in a month
Hobby 10hrs each week, normalize in a year
Fitness 2.5hrs intense physical activity per week, normalize in a year, 3.0hrs per week is max carryover, pre+post to intense physical activity is tracked but not part of the goal
Family 10hrs each week, normalize in a year
Personal The Rest

Routines
*Hobby ➜ On Purpose
*Family ➜ Bring Kids To School
*Family ➜ Beth's request
*Personal ➜ Bedtime Process and Sleep
*Personal ➜ Church calling

Prioritization
Work ｜ 8hrs each weekday, not Sunday, normalize in a month
 ⎣Work ➜ More Urgent Than Meetings ｜ [Take] 0%+ When working on pauses all time debt+surplus for child items
   ⎣Work ➜ Team Meetings ｜ Whatever it takes
     ⎣Work ➜ Travel to work ｜ 3 days a week (est 30min there and 30min back), normalize in a year, does not count towards work time goal
       ⎣Work ➜ More Urgent Than Promised Scheduled Work | 0%+ When working on pauses all time debt+surplus for child items
         ⎣Personal or Family, Flagged During The Day ｜ 4 hrs/week, normalized yearly, time also counts towards the primary time slot, time does not count towards work time goal
         ⎣Work ➜ Compliance ｜ 2 hrs/week, normalized monthly, Compliance meeting has urgency of Team Meetings but counts towards this time, Unread + Flagged Emails in Compliance Outlook folder, Checking Compliance website and resulting items unless they are sprint work
         ⎣Work ➜ Security Champ ｜ 2 hr/week, normalized quarterly, Unread + Flagged Emails in Security Champ Outlook folder, Security Champ meetings

         ⎣Work ➜ Handle Live-Site Incidents Assigned to Me ｜ Whatever it takes, check daily
         ⎣Work ➜ Awareness & Support ｜ Of Remaining, Up to 30% Daily, normalize monthly, team code reviews (check daily), Unread + Flagged in Inbox Outlook folder, check & respond to Team's messages, etc.
         ⎣Work ➜ Sprint Work   ｜ Of Remaining, At least 70% Daily, normalize monthly
