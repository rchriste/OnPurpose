# Show the Next Step First

Knowing the exact next step to take is inspiring because it focuses on the achievable. The user interface of a to do app should encourage the user to break work down to the next step and this next step should be shown prominently when the user's goal is to pick something to do. The following is an example list that does this:

```Text
Smaller Next Step ⬅ Larger To Do Item
You can also have multiple levels ⬅ Smaller medium sized step ⬅ Larger To Do Item
For example, next step is to explain inspiring through covering ⬅ Create On Purpose
```

This practice of first showing the next step is a key principal behind the design of _On Purpose_. When in the default Bullet List view the next step is shown first followed by the context of what item or items this next step is a sub-item of.
