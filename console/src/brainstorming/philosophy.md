# Philosophy

My philosophy is to work out how time management works fundamentally and to work out a way of seeing or perceiving time management in regards to what things are just observationally just how it is and then leverage that as a starting point or as the base behind working out or thinking through how a software program can aid or help with the problem of time management.
